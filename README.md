# Drowsiness-Detection-using-OpenCV
Please download and include the dlib facial 68 point facial landamark pre trained file from https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 , as github isnt allowing us to upload a file of size greater than 25 MB.
The attention level of driver degrade because of less sleep, long continuous driving or any other medical condition like brain disorders etc. Several surveys on road accidents says that around 30 percent of accidents are caused by fatigue of the driver. When driver drives for more than normal period for human then excessive fatigue is caused and also results in tiredness which drives the driver to sleepy condition or loss of consciousness.  We have developed a drowsiness detection system using OpenCV which monitors the eyes of the driver in real time and alerts the driver in case the driver feels drowsy. That way the system will be helpful in reducing road accidents.
